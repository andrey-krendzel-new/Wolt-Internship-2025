# Wolt Front-end Internship 2025

Made using React + Typescript + Vite

To run the project:

```
git clone
cd /wolt-ts-2025
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run the tests:
`npm run test`

NOTE: For testing/prototyping purposes: handleCalculateDistance(), distance is set to 1500. Edit the return to the variable "distance" to enable dynamic distance calculation.

The functions and formula to calculate the distance based on user coordinates and venue coordinates are there.

How the app works:

1. Introduce venue, cart value in the inputs.
2. Press "Get location" button to acquire user longitude and latitude.
3. Press "Calculate delivery fee" button to calculate delivery fee, delivery distance, small order surcharge, and total price.
